            <h2>TV Shows</h2>
            <p>One of the most famous TV Shows for the fall season is <em>Gilmore Girls,</em> which is about a mother-daughter bond between Rory Gilmore and her single mother Lorelai Gilmore and their life in their town called Stars Hollow. This show includes themes such as family dynamics, relationships, ambition, and financial troubles. Other TV Shows that are perfect for the fall season include <em>Friends, Twilight, Pretty Little Liars,</em> and <em>Glee.</em></p>
            <p>If you’re looking for some new releases, the fifth Season of <em>Stranger Things</em> is your best bet! <em>Stranger Things</em> is another popular TV Show on Netflix that was released on July 15, 2016, and since then, it has been a major hit! It has an interesting plot about a kid who gets kidnapped and sent to a parallel universe called the Upside Down. It is up to his friends, police officers, and a girl with supernatural powers to not only find him, but to uncover a bunch of secrets and horrors of their hometown of Hawkins, Indiana. It is set to release its new and final season coming out on November 26, 2025, and it’ll end on New Year’s Eve. We’d say that’s the perfect way to end the year!</p>
