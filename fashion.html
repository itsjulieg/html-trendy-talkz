        <h1>Fall Fashion</h1>
        <p>Fall fashion is one of the most exciting parts of the fall season but choosing a style or pieces of clothing can be pretty difficult! Luckily, there are so many trendy clothing pieces to choose from, and we even provided some tips on how you can be a part of some fall aesthetics! </p>
        <div>
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The term “aesthetic” made its rise to fame on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and it has been used to describe one’s style or vibe. Many have used aesthetics to develop a sense of individuality among themselves. Aesthetics also incorporate certain color palettes, whether it’s bright pastel colors or shades of red and brown. This year's aesthetic: the Downtown aesthetic. </p>

            <p>The Downtown aesthetic is simple yet cozy aesthetic, originally fantasizing the downtown areas of cities. The aesthetic then evolved to people dressing and acting accordingly. The Downtown aesthetic incorporates shades of red, brown, and even navy blue, and clothing pieces such as striped sweaters, a cardigan, and some Doc Martens. If you have these items, you could be able to pull off this aesthetic too!</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Clothing</h2>   
        <p>If you're going for a fancier look, be sure to include lots of leather jackets, off-the-shoulder sweaters, and plaided skirts. Or some oversized sweaters, flared jeans, or some loungewear if your style is more on the simple side. Since dark weather like rain, wind and cloudy days take place often during the fall, dark colors such as olive green, navy blue, browns, and beiges are the best color choices to fit the mood. If you’re looking for more inspiration, maybe incorporate some knitted and crochet pieces as well.</p>

        <p>Knitting and crocheting, for many years, have been considered “old lady” hobbies, but ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been hobbies that teenagers, young adults, and even kids have picked up. If knitted and crochet pieces interest you, be sure to buy or make sweaters, cardigans, beanies, and leg warmers this year. </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Fall fashion is absolutely iconic! From the cozy fall sweaters to the knitted beanies for the chilly days, you are sure to catch up with the fashion trends this season. What are you waiting for? You can find all these cute clothing pieces at a clothing store or craft store near you!</p>
