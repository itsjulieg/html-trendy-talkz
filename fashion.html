                    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
                    <p>Some of you may be asking, “What does the term ‘aesthetic’ have to do with this?” Well, this
                        term made its rise to fame on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and it has
                        been used to describe one’s style or vibe. Many have used aesthetics to develop a sense of
                        individuality among themselves. Aesthetics also incorporate certain color palettes, whether
                        it’s bright pastel colors or shades of red and brown. Although there are many fall
                        aesthetics, this year's trending aesthetic is the Downtown aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>The Downtown aesthetic is a simple yet cozy aesthetic, originally fantasizing the downtown
                        areas of cities. The aesthetic then evolved to people dressing and acting accordingly. The
                        Downtown aesthetic incorporates shades of red, brown, and even navy blue, and clothing
                        pieces such as striped sweaters, a cardigan, and some Doc Martens. If you have these items,
                        you could pull off this aesthetic too! If this aesthetic doesn’t interest you, we’re sure
                        you’ll love the Coquette, Cottagecore, and Old Money aesthetics!</p>

                    <h2>Clothing</h2>
                    <p>Grab a pen and paper, because here are some of our favorite clothing pieces this fall season.
                        If you're going for a fancier look, be sure to include lots of leather jackets,
                        off-the-shoulder sweaters, and plaided skirts. Or if your style is more on the simple side,
                        try some oversized sweaters, flared jeans, or some loungewear. Since dark weather like rain,
                        wind and cloudy days take place often during the fall, dark colors such as olive green, navy
                        blue, browns, and beiges are the best color choices to fit the mood. If you’re looking for
                        more inspiration, incorporate some knitted and crochet pieces as well.</p>
                    <p>Knitting and crocheting, for many years, have been considered “old lady” hobbies, but ever
                        since the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been hobbies that teenagers, young adults, and even
                        kids have picked up. If knitted and crochet pieces interest you, be sure to buy or make
                        sweaters, cardigans, beanies, and leg warmers this year. </p>
